                        <h2 class="h5 mb-0">One, Inc. v. Olsen</h2><span class="small text-gray"><i class="fa fa-clock-o mr-1"></i><strong>1958 One, Inc. v. Olsen</strong></span>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case was one of the first cases that considered LGBTQ rights concerned freedom of speech. <i>The final decision of this case was that people had the right to publish LGBTQ media because there lifestyles and behavior weren't "inherently obscene".</i> </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="timeline-item bg-white rounded ml-3 p-4 shadow">

                        <h2 class="h5 mb-0">Baker v. Nelson</h2><span class="small text-gray"><i class="fa fa-clock-o mr-1"></i><strong>1972 Baker v. Nelson</strong></span>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case considered, for the first time, the issue of marriage equality. This all started because a same-sex couple was reported for attempting to get married. John Baker, one of the men in question, enrolled in law school just to find a loophole. <i>The Supreme Court decision was to ignore this case and it had little impact on the community. Later the two men were able to get married in Minnesota.</i></p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case was a major blow to the LGBTQ rights movement when the court made the decision to uphold an outdated Georgia sodomy law. <i>The decison of this court case gave the Gay community the identity of "criminal" for engaging in Gay acts and only furthered the negative stigma toward the community. This was also the time of the AIDS epidemic so the issues were only worsened.</i></p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case was famous for overturning a past Colorado law, which didn't allowed cities to make anti-discrimination laws for people. <i>The courts decision was ruled that laws couldn't single out LGBTQ people to take away their rights.</i></p>
                    </li>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case did the opposite of progress for the LGBTQ community. In 1990 the Boy Scouts of America expelled James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster and Eagle Scout, for being a leader in a university Lesbian/Gay Alliance. <i>The courts decision was to rule in favor of the Boy Scouts of America because his homosexual conduct went against their values as an organization.</i></p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case is famous for overturning the Bowers v. Hardwick case, which made sodomy illegal in some states. <i>The courts decision to eliminate sodomy laws was a big turning point for Gay rights. The court recognized that the LGBTQ community are entitled to constitutional protections for intimate conduct.</i></p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="timeline-item bg-white rounded ml-3 p-4 shadow">

                        <h2 class="h5 mb-0">United States v. Windsor</h2><span class="small text-gray"><i class="fa fa-clock-o mr-1"></i><strong>2013 United States v. Windsor</strong></span>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This court case was monumental in leading the way to marriage equality. <i>The court made the decision to eliminate the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which stated that a legal union is between one man and one woman. This decision was one step closer to equality.</i></p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="timeline-item bg-white rounded ml-3 p-4 shadow">

                        <h2 class="h5 mb-0">Obergefell v. Hodges</h2><span class="small text-gray"><i class="fa fa-clock-o mr-1"></i><strong>2015 Obergefell v. Hodges</strong></span>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This case is famous as the case that granted marriage equality to the LGBTQ community. It started and ended with a group of 14 same-sex couples who connected due to the connection of there partners passing away. They joined together and won the biggest victory for LGBTQ rights. <i>The courts decision granted marriage rights, as well as any other benefits opposite-sex couples already experienced like social security and survivor benefits.</i></p>

      <p class="card-text">The stonewall riots began on June 28th, 1969 and ended on July 3rd, 1969. The riots were started at the historic Stonewall Inn in New York City and they began due to police brutality and unlawful search and seizure of a Gay owned, operated, and attended establishment. The Stonewall riots started due to this brutality and spanned multiple days. Many people credit this historic moment as the full start of the Gay Right movement, which is still an ongoing battle and will be for a while. This video gives good insight into the horrible treatment and history of Gay people during this time.</p>

      <p class="card-text">The 80's AIDS crisis affected so many families and killed so many people within the Gay community that the disease is still closely related to the LGBTQ community. Even after all the scientific proof that this disease didn't come from Gay people the community still holds this stigma forever. The reason this epidemic was so huge was because it was new, there was no cure, and it was affecting mainly Gay communitties at the time. This short video gives insight into the early start of this epidemic.</p>

The stripe in the middle is white, for those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender. The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it, it is always correct, signifying us finding correctness in our lives.”

Polysexuality is a self-identifying term that is somewhat amorphous, as there is a wide variety of different people who use the term to describe themselves. Polysexual identity is related to gender identity and is used by some people who identify outside the binarist gender spectrum.

Yellow represents those whose gender exists outside of and without reference to the binary, as yellow is often used to distinguish something as its own. White represents those who have many or all genders, as white is the photological presence of color and/or light. The purple stripe represents those who feel their gender is between or a mix of female and male, as purple is the mix of traditional boy and girl colors. The purple could also be seen as representing the fluidity and uniqueness of nonbinary people. The final black stripe represents those who feel they are without gender, as black is the photological absence of color and/or light.

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">The Genderqueer flag was designed by Marilyn Roxie with input from the readers of Genderqueer Identities in June 2011. Lavender represents androgyny or simply queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary.

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">In 2018, the Pride flag saw another variation in its design known as the Progress Pride Flag, created by Daniel Quasar to be more inclusive. Overlaying the traditional six-striped rainbow flag is a chevron design that has the black and brown stripes from the Philly Pride flag, as well as white, pink, and blue from the Trans Pride flag.

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">2020 saw the display of the QPOC Pride Flag rise in popularity in the broader queer community as a sign of solidarity with Black Lives Matter demonstrations seen across the country and world. The flag represents queer people of color (QPOC) and how the black community and the queer community are often woven together, both currently and in the earliest days of the Queer Liberation Movement. The raised fist was added to the six-striped flag and includes various shades of brown and a white stripe to represent the various colors of the “human rainbow.”

  <h1>Being the Most Authentic YOU</h1>
  <h3>What is a Pronoun & why it matters</h3>
  <p>In English, our most commonly used pronouns (he/she) specifically refer to a person’s gender. For queer, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and transgender people, these pronouns may not fit, can create discomfort, and can cause stress and anxiety.</p>
  <h3>Some Common Terms to Know:</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Gender Identity:</strong>The internal perception of one’s gender, and how they label themselves, based on how much they align or don’t align with what they understand their options for gender to be.</li>
  	<li><strong>SEX:</strong>Sex is a label, "male or female", that you’re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the genitals you’re born with and the chromosomes you have. It does not necessarily match someone’s gender / gender identity.</li>
  	<li><strong>Cisgender:</strong>Applies to someone whose gender matches their “assigned” sex at birth.</li>
  	<li><strong>Transgender:</strong>Applies to a person whose gender is different from their “assigned” sex at birth. Doctors typically assign gender based on sexual organs, but sex and gender are different.</li>
  	<li><strong>Non-binary:</strong>Non-binary, similar to genderqueer, is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or exclusively feminine‍—‌identities that are outside the gender binary of male and female.</li>
  	<li><strong>Gender Fluid:</strong>Applies to a person whose gender identity changes over time or changes at different times.</li>
  	<li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong>An emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people; of the same gender, different gender or multiple genders.</li>
  </ul>

      <p class="card-text">In 1994, producers Peggy Rajski and Randy Stone saw writer/performer Celeste Lecesne bring to life Trevor, a character they created as part of their award-winning one-man show WORD OF MOUTH. Convinced Trevor’s story would make a wonderful short film, Stone and Rajski invited Lecesne to adapt it into a screenplay. Rajski directed the movie and TREVOR went on to win many prestigious awards including the Academy Award® for Best Live Action Short Film. In 1998 The Trevor Project was founded and is the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25.</p>
